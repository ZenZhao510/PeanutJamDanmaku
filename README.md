Touhou Danmakufu ph3 does not belong to me, rather it is an engine to run bullet hell scripts.
Enemy character, bullet patterns were developed by me, the bullet sprites were taken from the default image sheet in the download of this program.
The player character Rumia and Touhou Project belongs to Team Shanghai Alice, this is a derivative work (very short demo, at least).
